## URLs After Deployment

- Landing: `https://withswag.org/`
- SRT Editor: `https://withswag.org/srt-editor/`
- Portrait: `https://withswag.org/portrait/`

## Ready to Deploy!

Everything is configured and built. Next steps:

1. Review the changes
2. Test locally with `vercel dev` (optional)
3. Deploy with `vercel --prod`
4. Test all three URLs

## Files Modified

- `easysrt/index.html` - Added Portrait card, updated SEO
- `easysrt/sitemap.xml` - Added Portrait URL
- `EasyPortrait/vite.config.ts` - Added base path
- `EasyPortrait/src/App.tsx` - Added basename to Router
- `EasyPortrait/dist/` - Built production files

## Files Created

- `vercel.json` - Root routing configuration
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive guide
- `QUICK_DEPLOY.md` - Quick reference
- `INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Notes

- Both projects remain separate and independent
- EasyPortrait needs to be rebuilt when you make changes
- Landing page and SRT editor are static (no build needed)
- All processing in Portrait tool happens client-side (privacy-first)
- Vercel will automatically detect and use the root `vercel.json`
